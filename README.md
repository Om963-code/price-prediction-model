# Final Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict final prices based on historical data. Key tasks include data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values, handled outliers, and standardized data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features like interaction terms and transformed existing ones.
- **Modeling**: Trained multiple regression models, including Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing algorithm.
- **Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Visualizations
- **Prediction vs. Actual**: Scatter plot comparing predicted prices with actual prices.
- **Feature Importance**: Bar chart showing the most influential features in the model.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/price-prediction-model`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the script/notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

## Results
- Achieved RMSE of 5.32 and R² of 0.89 using Gradient Boosting on the test set.
- Key predictors: `Unit Price`, `Promotion Type`, and `Customer Demographics`.
